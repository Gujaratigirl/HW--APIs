# HW--APIs


## For the WeatherPy assignment we were looking to answer the simple question "What's the weather like as we approach the equator?" with data.

I believe some of the the plots did a much better job at representing this common knowledge piece of information-"Duh. It gets hotter..."

The samples was a resonable distribution.  
Range from -90 to 90 for latitude and -180 to 180 for longitude. Near the poles there will be less cities so don't expect the sample to have a to many on the far edges.  This sample will represent the population of cities well, so that we may observe trends in the data.   

Maximum temperature showed the easiest relationship to observe.  As cities approch the equator the maximume temperature rises.  
Cloudiness was also slightly representative of this, as cities got closer the the equator the cloudiness decreased.  

I don't believe that humidity and wind speed are that accurate at showcasing data to enhance our project question.  Perhaps if more cities or a different data set of cities (program run again and multiple sets of plot were compared) were analyzed these pieces of information would show more dramatic information.  

I have made comments for each of my plots in the program file.  Please reference those for my specific thoughts on the individual analysis.

I also think the plot requested for this assignment are very limited.  The data doesn't allow us to make observation in relation to altitude or proximity to water sources.  These things would drastically enhance humidity and wind speed data.
