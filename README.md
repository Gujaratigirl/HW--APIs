# HW--APIs
##  *Please use file WeatherPy.ipynb in the WeatherPy folder*

## *The gmaps library didnot work when installing for the class therefore the instuctor told us not to complete this part of the assignment*
As this assignment was shorter than previous ones and only half of what was originally expected my number of commits is much lower than previous assignments. 

## For the WeatherPy assignment we were looking to answer the simple question "What's the weather like as we approach the equator?" with data.

I believe some of the the plots did a much better job at representing this common knowledge piece of information-"Duh. It gets hotter..." 

Maximum temperature showed the easiest relationship to observe.  As cities approch the equator the maximume temperature rises.  
Cloudiness was also slightly representative of this, as cities got closer the the equator the cloudiness decreased.  

I don't believe that humidity and wind speed are that accurate at showcasing data to enhance our project question.  Perhaps if more cities or a different data set of cities (program run again and multiple sets of plot were compared) were analyzed these pieces of information would show more dramatic information.

I also think the plot requested for this assignment are very limited.  The data doesn't allow us to make observation in relation to altitude or proximity to water sources.  These things would drastically enhance humidity and wind speed data.
